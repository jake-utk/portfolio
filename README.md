## User Stories for MVP

- As a user, I would like to see a link to a resume that opens in a different tab, so I don't have to hit the "back" button to return to the page.
- As a user, I would like the option to download a PDF of the resume.
- As a user, I would like to be be able to contact the creator directly via a button on the landing page, so I can hire him immediately.
- As a user, I would like to see a picture displayed of the creator, so I can put a face to a name.
- As a user, I would like to see each language that the creator has worked with, so I'm aware of their experience.

## User Stories for Stretch Features

- As a user, I would like to see design, so I can tell they're great at CSS.
- As a user, I would like to see a video of a coding challenge being tackled by the user, so I can watch their logical approach live.
- As a user, I would like to be able to indicate if I'm an observer, a fan, or an employer, so the creator has a better idea of who's visiting the site.
