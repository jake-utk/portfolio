# Portfolio-Resume Site

## Project Description
- A personal webspace to display resume, github links, project summaries, upcoming initiatives, etc.

## Project Link
- www.jakeaddis.com

## User Stories for MVP
- As a user, I would like to see a link to a resume that opens in a different tab, so I don't have to hit the "back" button to return to the page.
- As a user, I would like the option to download a PDF of the resume.
- As a user, I would like to be be able to contact the creator directly via a button on the landing page, so I can hire him immediately.
- As a user, I would like to see a picture displayed of the creator, so I can put a face to a name.
- As a user, I would like to see each language that the creator has worked with, so I'm aware of their experience.

## User Stories for Stretch Features
- As a user, I would like to see design, so I can tell they're great at CSS.
- As a user, I would like to see a video of a coding challenge being tackled by the user, so I can watch their logical approach live.
- As a user, I would like to be able to indicate if I'm an observer, a fan, or an employer, so the creator has a better idea of who's visiting the site.

## Hurdles
- Website responsiveness across all screen sizes
- React-burger-menu, getting this to close with a single click on a selected link has been difficult.  The docs recommend to employ useContext here, but it isn't resulting in the desired interaction.
- React-burger-menu, linking the pathing to each section on the single-page version of the application, instead of the multi-page initial approach.
- CSS in general has been much better than ever before, but there's still a huge hurdle of text/image alignment in each section in a way that will remain consistent across all screen sizes.
